# Note on what software means
Software within this license refers to the "Software" and the R code documents, dataset csv files, and DockerFiles. 
It does not refer to the Word documents or PowerPoint documents; these are not allowed for use in the same way as the "Software"; permission must be sought.
These are individual pieces of works that are used to show either a) a piece of marked, or soon-to-be-marked work for a course b) a piece of work whereby I retain the right to use solely for individual, 
personal usage
c) pieces of work for you, the viewer, to look at to see, among other things, dissertation structure, poster structure, literature review ideas, etc so that inspiration can be taken to better one's own research
through your own criticality of the documentation. Simply, these are here within the repository for a) convenience
b) 'cloud based' backups c) to demonstrate writing/design ability as part of a larger portfolio.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
